# US 033 - As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task

## 1. Requirements Engineering

In scrum, the requirements of the project are expressed as ***user stories*** and the set of all user stories is the ***
project backlog***.

The project timeline is divided into sprints (multiple of weeks). Each sprint has a ***sprint backlog***, i.e. the set
of user stories that should be addressed during the sprint. A user story may include several ***tasks*** that have to be
done for the user story to be completed. During the sprint, project team members register work done in these tasks.

There may be ***other technical or general/independent tasks*** that are not related to a user story like meetings that
have an effort (e.g. sprint review, sprint retrospective, etc.) and non-functional requirements related to system
deployment, and there may be an effort related to it.

The ***update of tasks*** is done by the ***team members***. A particular scenario of updating tasks is to update the
effort. As each resource spends time with a task, you must update it with the time recording used. Each update should
originate a record with a comment associated with the task, where attachment files can be added.

### 1.1. User Story Description

As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

***Question to PO*** - Will The task outside the scope of tha user story be always related to a sprint? Or could be
tasks related only to a project?

***PO Answer*** - There are no tasks outside the scope of a sprint.

***Question to PO*** - are tasks supposed to have one or more logs associated with them to record the work? Or simply
increment the "hours spent" attribute?

***PO Answer*** - The way you define the tasks will condition the activity report. If a task has one and only one
associated resource, the process is simplified. It also doesn't shock me that a task's effort is updated instead of
keeping multiple records. Although several records can be interesting in some scenarios.

***Question to PO*** - When the SM/Team Member wants to record the work done on a task, do they only record the hours
spent, or also record/add comments?

***PO Answer*** - It may make sense to post comments.

We consider the following interpretations:

- task has one and only one associated resource then him/her is the responsible to update it and record the work daily;
- task has one or more logs associated with them to record work and keep various logs by incrementing the tasks' "hours
  spent" attribute;
- user story has a "work done" attribute that updates with the record work of the related tasks;

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- ACP001: work time cannot be null or negative or higher than a day;
- ACP002: it can only register one daily effort by task;
- ACP003: as mandatory input values **effort hours** and **effort minutes**;
- ACP004: as optional **effort date** (if not typed the current date is set by default), **comment**, **attachment**.

  - the effort hours;
  - the effort minutes;
  - the effort date;
  - a comment;
  - an attachment.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- the effort of the created task will allow the update of the total hours spent, status and percentage of execution of
  the task and total hours of the corresponding user story.

# 4. Tests

We try to think about how we want to test each class and method used in this US, therefore we have listed the tests
below:

### 4.1. TaskEffort tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| TaskEffort | Success: with all values valid|
| TaskEffort |    Success: with optional values empty
| TaskEffort |    Success: no date typed (assumes the local date)
| TaskEffort | Success: with effort only with minutes (hours = 0)
| TaskEffort |    Success: with effort only with hours (minutes = 0)
| TaskEffort |    Fail: no working time typed (hours and minutes = 0)
| TaskEffort | Fail: effort hours negative
| TaskEffort |    Fail: effort minutes negative
| TaskEffort |    Fail: effort hours > day
| TaskEffort | Fail: effort minutes > hour
| TaskEffort |    Fail: effort date in the future

### 4.2. Task tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| Task | Success: create task with no task effort (to check the default task values)
| Task |    Success: create task effort with all values valid
| Task |    Fail: create task effort with effort date not matching task responsible dates
| Task |   Success: save first effort of the task **checks** if task hours spent increments with the  effort time; effort Remaining decrements correspondingly; execution Percentage increments correspondingly; task start date sets with the effort date; task status is set to “Running” 
| Task |   Success: save another effort (not finishing the task) **checks** if task hours spent increments with the  effort time; effortRemaining decrements correspondingly; executionPercentage increments correspondingly; task start date/end date is not updated; task status stills at “Running”
| Task |   Success: save effort (finishing the task) **checks** if hours spent keeps incrementing; effortRemaining set to 0; executionPercentage set to 100%; task end date sets with the effort date; task status set to “Finished”
| Task |   Success: save effort (finishing the task but passing the task remaining effort) **checks** if hours spent keeps incrementing; effortRemaining minimum is 0; executionPercentage max is 100%; task end date keeps setting; task status stills at “Finished”
| Task |   Success: save effort (in task set already to “Finished”) **checks** if hours spent keeps incrementing; effortRemaining minimum is 0; executionPercentage max is 100%; task end date keeps setting; task status stills at “Finished”
| Task |   Fail: save two equal task effort
| Task |   Fail: save another effort in the same day


### 4.3. UserStory tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| UserStory | Success: update user story work done value after the registration of an effort;

### 4.4. Controller tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| RegisterWorkToTaskController |Success: getTasksTest()|
| RegisterWorkToTaskController |    Success: getTaskTest()|
| RegisterWorkToTaskController |    Success: createTaskEffortTest()|
