### 1.1. User Story Description

As Project Manager, I want to start a sprint

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

The Project Manager will start the sprint.

***Team Ask*** - What does starting a sprint entail?

***PO Answer*** - The team can start working.

***Team Ask*** - What can we consider "Start a Sprint"?

***PO Answer*** - The sprint goes into the state of started on the date defined by the PM. As for the rest, user stories about Sprint Planning, etc., are not yet defined.

***Team Ask*** - Can the PM start the Sprint earlier than the previously planned date? And start later?

***PO Answer*** - Yes, it can.

***Team Ask*** - If it can be started later than the planned date, can it be started in the period of a later Sprint?

***PO Answer*** - Sure. There can only be one active sprint at any given time, that is, there are no overlapping sprints. I remember that sprints have a sequential numbering.

***Team Ask*** - Can a planned Sprint not start?

***PO Answer*** - Sure. It may mean that the project ended (successfully or cancelled) before running the sprint.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC001: ;
- AC002: ;
- AC003: ;


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US have a dependency to this user stories: 
 
- US008 - Edit some project information; 
- US016 - View status of activities in a project;
- US022 - Create a sprint.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- To start sprint the actor must validate some parameters:
    - **start date**: the start date needs to be before the end date of the last sprint and, if necessary, can be a "pause" between sprints;
    - **project team** the actual project team must have at least a PO and a SM available to that sprint date and during the sprint duration.
    - 
- If those validations were true:
    - **id sprint**: the sprint ID will be automatically setted;
    - **start date**: the sprint will start with the current date.

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	Iterate with UI	|Controller|GRASP - Controller|
| Step 2  		 |	Pass data between systems | ResourceDto | DTO Pattern |
| Step 3  		 |	Create and manage DTO |  ProjectTeamMapper |  Mapper Pattern                            |

### Systematization ##

[comment]: <> (According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: )

[comment]: <> ( * Class1)

[comment]: <> ( * Class2)

[comment]: <> ( * Class3)

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * StartASprintUI  
 * StarASprintController
 * StarASprintDTO
 * ProjectStore
 * SprintList
## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values. 

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }
	

*It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections.* 


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
