# US 028 - As Director, I want to get a list of all human resources in a project

## 1. Requirements Engineering

Director has access to all projects in the system. Each project has one project team where there are a list of all human resources associated with that project (actual, previous and future).
The human resources associated with the project is saved in the class named Project Team.

The Resources associated to a project is a system user and must have the following information: 
- Start date;
- End date;
- Cost per hour (monetary value that the resource costs for each hour used in the
project);
- Percentage of allocation (100% for full-time, or the percentage corresponding to part-time);

The system should ensure that at no time (i.e. week) is a resource associated with an allocation
of more than 100% in different projects. You should also ensure that a resource is not
associated with project activities that go out of the allocation time they have set.

These Resources can be added to a project without a role but while performing tasks must be assigned to a role in the project team (i.g. Project Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team Member). Each Project Team only have one PO, PM and SM at a time. 

The project team is a list that save all resources with their role at a given time.

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Director, I want to get a list of all human resources in a project.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

Director will receive a list of all human resources associated to that project.
***Team Ask*** - Do Director want see all active resources or all resources that already worked in the Project?

***PO Answer*** - Everyone assigned to the project.

We consider that Director wants to check all human resources that were, are and will be assigned to the Project.

Each time a resource is assigned to a new role the end date of the role he had before is changed and a new resource is created.

***Team Ask*** - Which information Director wants to see about the human resources in the project?

***PO Answer*** - Name, e-mail and role.

Since we considered present all resources assigned (past, present and future) to the project we will also provide role (if there is a role assigned), start date and end date for this system user/role, together with percentage of allocation and cost per hour. 

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC001: it needs to return a list DTO;
- AC002: it needs to return string data type for all information;

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US have a dependency to this user stories: 
- US001 - Register a user; 
- US002 - Activate user account; 
- US005 - Create a project; 
- US007 - Associate user to a project; 
- US014 - Define SM of a project;
- US027 - Define PO of a project;

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**

_Project Code_: project where to check the human resources associated

_Output Data_:
List of all projects

List of resources associated to the project:
- name of human resource;
- e-mail of human resource;
- start date;
- end date;
- role;
- cost per hour;
- percentage of allocation.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	Iterate with UI	|Controller|GRASP - Controller|
| Step 2  		 |	Pass data between systems | ResourceDto | DTO Pattern |
| Step 3  		 |	Create and manage DTO |  ProjectTeamMapper |  Mapper Pattern                            |

### Systematization ##

[comment]: <> (According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: )

[comment]: <> ( * Class1)

[comment]: <> ( * Class2)

[comment]: <> ( * Class3)

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * GetHResourceProjectUI  
 * GetHResourceProjectController

# 4. Tests 

We try to think about how we want to test each class and method used in this US,
therefore we have listed the tests below:

##4.1. Controller tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| GetListHResourceProjectController |	Ensure that the methods return a list|
| GetListHResourceProjectController |	Ensure that the methods return a empty list|
| GetListHResourceProjectController |	Ensure that the methods work with many scenarios to create a new task|
| GetListHResourceProjectController |	Ensure that Mapper and DTO pattern were working|

# 6. Integration and Demo 

This functionality was not hard to implement since all the classes were developed on previous sprints. The new implementation was DTO.


# 7. Observations

Our team should work on better testing.
