# US 010 - As Authenticated User, I want to update its own personal data (e.g. photo, function, ...)

## 1. Requirements Engineering


To get access to the system a user must enter credentials in the form of email and password.
After successful authentication, the system should create a session that will allow the user to 
be identified in subsequent requests.

The system should make it possible to register users through a form accessible via a link in the
login zone. Each user's registration must request at least the following information:

 - Name;
 - Function;
 - E-mail;
 - Password;
 - Password confirmation; 
 - Photo (optional).

Creating accounts in the system must ensure that the email address used is unique.


### 1.1. User Story Description

As Authenticated User, I want to update its own personal data (e.g. photo, function, ...)

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

The Authenticated User will update its own personal data.

***Team Ask*** - When making any changes to the authorized personal data fields, will it be possible to change only 
one of them or will you have to change all of them?

***PO Answer*** - It can change everything or change nothing.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC001: the username field must not be empty;
- AC002: the username field must have a length higher than 2 letters; 
- AC003: the function field must not be empty;
- AC004: the function field must have a length higher than 2 letters;
- AC005: the photo field is optional.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US have a dependency to this user stories: 
 
- US001 - As Non-Registered User, I want to register as an application user;
- US002 - As Non-Registered User, I want to activate a just registered user account;
- US011 - As Authenticated User, I want to change his/her password.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- To update personal data the actor can:
    - **username**: update this field but cannot leave it empty;
    - **function**: update this field but cannot leave it empty;
    - **photo**: this field can be empty or can be with an attachment.

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	Ator (Authenticated User) iterate with UI	|UpdatePersonalDataUI|GRASP|
| Step 2  		 |	UI iterate with Controller	|UpdatePersonalDataController|GRASP / HC + LC|
| Step 3  		 |	Update Personal Data  | SystemUserStore | GRASP - Pure Fabrication / HC + LC |

# 4. Tests 

We try to think about how we want to test each class and method used in this US,
therefore we have listed the tests below:

###4.1. Controller tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| UpdatePersonalDataController |	Ensure that the methods work with many scenarios to update personal data|
| UpdatePersonalDataController |	Ensure that store pattern were working|

      updateSystemUserDataSuccess() {
      //Arrange
      Company company = new Company();
      UserProfile userProfile = company.getUserProfileStore().getUserProfile("Visitor");
      UpdatePersonalDataController controllerTest = new UpdatePersonalDataController(company);
      SystemUser user1 = new SystemUser("Joana", "123@isep.ipp.pt", "Aluna", "AAA",
      "AAA","img_123", userProfile);
      company.getSystemUserStore().saveSystemUser(user1);
      //Act
      controllerTest.getUser("123@isep.ipp.pt");
      //Assert
      assertTrue(controllerTest.updateSystemUserData("Joana Isabel Silva", "Aluna_numero10", "imagem_300"));
      }

###4.1. Model tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| SystemUser |	Check if all data is setted, with success|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with username field empty|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with username field with low length|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with all empty fields|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with all fields are null|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with function field empty|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with function field with low length|
| SystemUser |	Check if all data isn't setted, with photo field empty|
| SystemUserStore |	Check if a user has an determinated email|
| SystemUserStore |	Check if a user hasn´t an determinated email|

- *Ensure if the personal data is setted:*


        setAllDataSuccess() {
        //Arrange
        Company company = new Company();
        UserProfile userProfile = company.getUserProfileStore().getUserProfile("Visitor");
        SystemUser joana = new SystemUser("Joana", "112@isep.ipp.pt", "Aluna_10",
                "123", "123", "img_123", userProfile);
        //Act and Assert
        assertTrue(joana.setAllData("Joana Silva", "Aluna_100", "img_900"));
    }

- *Check if the personal data isn´t setted:*


        setAllDataFailNull() {
        //Assert
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        //Arrange
        UserProfile tes = new UserProfile("ddd");
        SystemUser newUser = new SystemUser("JJJJ", "112@isep.ipp.pt",
        "Aluna_10", "123", "123", "img_900", tes);
        newUser.setAllData(null, null, null);
        });
        }

# 6. Integration and Demo

Because many of the usage classes were already made and yours business logic were consolidated,
the integration with them was simple. We need to verify some rules and implement others,
but most of our work was devoted to the design and tests.

# 6. Observations

As team, we need to understand how to better perform unitary and integrations tests, and how to integrate all 
GRASP, HC+LC and low coupling methods.
