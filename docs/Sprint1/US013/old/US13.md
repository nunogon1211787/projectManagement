# US 013 - As Administrator, I want to create user profiles


## 1. Requirements Engineering

The system should allow the configuration of profiles associated with users, in order to restrict
access to features. Each profile will have permissions associated with available actions and
functionalities. A user account can have one or more profiles.

When registration is made, it is automatically associated with the visitor/guest profile, and
then the administrator can add other available profiles.

The Administrator profile allows associating profiles with the remaining users of the system,
and therefore an account with this profile should be automatically created at the time the
system is installed.

The Director is a profile that allows the user to have access to all projects.


### 1.1. User Story Description

As Administrator, I want to create user profiles.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**Team Ask** - Does this user story refer to user profiles (administrator, visitor, director) or special profiles (Project Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master)? Or both?

**PO Answer** - I get the impression that they are confusing user profiles in the system with roles associated with projects.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- ACP001: There are already some predefined profiles: Administrator, Director, Visitor, User;
- ACP002: Visitor/guest profile associated at the time of registration;
- ACP003: Administrator profile should be automatically created at the time the system is installed;
- ACP004: Director is a profile that allows the user to have access to all projects;

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US have a dependency to this user stories:
- US001 - Register a user;
- US002 - Activate user account;
- US003 - Administrator to assign a profile;
- US006 - Administrator update profiles assigned to a user account;

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

####Input Data
To create a new profile, the administrator will have to choose the option to create a profile and fill in a form where the name of the profile to be created will be placed.

####Output Data
A successful profile creation message will be displayed.

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer      | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |		Request creation of a user profile					 | UserProfile |            GRASP - Pure Fabrication / HC + LC                   |
| Step 2  		 |		 Iterate with UI						 |     Controller        |       GRASP - Controller                       |
| Step 3  		 |				Saves information about profiles			 |       UserProfileStore      |   GRASP - Pure Fabrication                           |
     

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * SystemUser

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * CreateUserProfileUI  
 * CreateUserProfileController
 * UserProfileStore

# 4. Tests 
We try to think about how we want to test each class and method used in this US,
therefore we have listed the tests below:


| Class                       | Test Goal                                                                              |
|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CreateUserProfileController | Ensure that the methods allows to create new profile with success                      |
| CreateUserProfileController | Return exception message, no name for profile inserted when the field is blank or null |
| CreateUserProfileController | 	Return exception message, when profile already exist                                  |                                |
| Company                     | 	Ensure that the methods return a list with results                                   |  


    @Test
    @DisplayName("Create new profile with success")
    public void createProfileWithSuccess() {
    Company company = new Company();
    CreateUserProfileController createUserProfileController = new CreateUserProfileController(company);
    String name = "Cris_Dani";
    boolean userProfileCreated = createUserProfileController.createUserProfile(name);
    assertTrue(userProfileCreated);
    }
    
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Return exception message, no name for profile inserted")
    public void createProfileWithEmptyName() {
        // Arrange
        Company company = new Company();
        CreateUserProfileController createUserProfileController = new CreateUserProfileController(company);
        String name = "";
        // Act
        Exception exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> createUserProfileController.createUserProfile(name));
        // Assert
        assertTrue(exception.getMessage().contains("Name cannot be blank."));
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Return exception message, profile already exist")
    public void createProfileAlreadyExist() {
        // Arrange
        Company company = new Company();
        CreateUserProfileController createUserProfileController = new CreateUserProfileController(company);
        String name = "Cris_Dani";
        // Act
        Exception exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            createUserProfileController.createUserProfile(name);
            createUserProfileController.createUserProfile(name);
        });
        // Assert
        assertTrue(exception.getMessage().contains("Repeated user profile name inserted."));
    }
