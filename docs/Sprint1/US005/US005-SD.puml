[o->  route: POST /projects (json)
route -> controller: createProject(inDto)

note right route: Json object was deserialize to a CreateProjectDto object

controller -> service: createAndSave\nProject(inDto)

service -> factory: createProject(inDto)

note over factory : All parameters (value objects) are instantiated in their own factories.

factory -> project**: create(name, description, ...)

factory --> service: newProject

service -> store: savedProject = save(newProject)
note over store : Saving project in Repository returns a new project created by jpa assembler

deactivate store

alt if the new project was correctly saved

service -> mapper: model2Dto(savedProject)

mapper -> dto**: create()

mapper --> service: projDTO

else if the new project was not saved

service --> exc** : create(errorMessage)

end

service --> controller: projDto

controller --> json**: create(projDto)

controller --> route: response
