# US 015 -  As Director, I want to get a list of all projects.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

In scrum, the requirements of the project are expressed as ***user stories*** and the set of all user stories is the ***project backlog***.

The project timeline is divided into sprints (multiple of weeks). Each sprint has a ***sprint backlog***, i.e. the set of user stories that should be addressed during the sprint.
A user story may include several ***tasks*** that have to be done for the user story to be completed.
During the sprint, project team members register work done in these tasks.

There may be ***other technical or general/independent tasks*** that not are related to a user story and must be followed (e.g. sprint planning, sprint review, non-functional requirements, etc.)

The ***creation of tasks*** is done by the ***team members***. The users available for the activities are the team members, the PO and the SM.

A task must have ***at least*** the following information:

- Name;
- Description;
- Start Date;
- End Date;
- Hours spent (0 at the time it is created);
- Effort estimate (start by having the initial estimate, but can be updated several times throughout the project; uses Fibonacci series for duration in hours.);
- Percentage of execution (0% if it has not yet started, up to 100% when it is completed; value calculated automatically based on the relationship between the hours spent and the estimated effort);
- Precedence (optional, list of tasks that must be completed before the start of the task);
- Type of task (Meeting / Documentation / Design / Implementation / Testing / Deployment);
- Task status (Planned / Running / Finished / Blocked);
- Responsible (human resource responsible for the execution of the task).


### 1.1. User Story Description

As Scrum Master or Team Member, I want to create a task outside the scope of the user story.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

***Team Ask*** - Will The task outside the scope of tha user story be always related to a sprint? Or could be tasks related only to a project?

***PO Answer*** - There not have tasks outside the scope of a sprint.

We consider the following interpretations:

- In the creation will be task attributes with default values:
  - **Start Date**: the start date only will be defined when have the first register of the effort in this task;
  - **End Date**:the end date will be defined when the percentage of execution are 100%;
  - **Status**: the initial status will be ***"Planned"***.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- ACP001: name must have at least 3 (three) characters;
- ACP002: description must have at least 20 (twenty) characters;
- ACP003: effort estimate must be higher than 0 (zero).
- ACP004: type cannot be null;
- ACP005: responsible cannot be null;

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

This US have a dependency to this user stories: 
- US001 - Register a user;
- US002 - Activate user account;
- US005 - Create a project;
- US007 - Associate user to a project;
- US022 - Create a sprint in a project;
- US029 - Start a sprint in a project.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

####Input Data
- To create a task the actor must choose some parameters:
    - **type**: will be provided a list of valid types;
    - **precedences** are optional: will be provided a list of tasks of the sprint;
    - **responsible**: will be provided a list of the project team current related to the sprint. The actor can choose everyone available in this list.
- To create a task the actor must fill some others parameters:
    - **name**;
    - **description**;
    - **effort estimate**.

####Output Data

This process will be only a return message with the state of the creation. In other words, success or fail.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	Create and manage Task|TaskList|GRASP - Pure Fabrication / HC + LC|
| Step 2  		 |	Iterate with UI|Controller|GRASP - Controller|
| Step 3  		 |	How to pass data between systems and reduce coupling|CreateTaskDTO|DTO Pattern|
| Step 4  		 |	How to create and manage DTO|TaskMapper|Mapper Pattern|
| Step 5  		 |	Create and manage TaskType|TaskTypeStore|GRASP - Pure Fabrication / HC + LC|
| Step 6  		 |	Create and manage TaskStatus|TaskStatusStore|GRASP - Pure Fabrication / HC + LC| 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Task
 * TaskType
 * TaskStatus

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * CreateSprintTaskUI  
 * CreateSprintTaskController
 * TaskTypeStore
 * TaskStatusStore
 * TaskList
 * CreateTaskDTO
 * TaskMapper

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

# 4. Tests 

We try to think about how we want to test each class and method used in this US, 
therefore we have listed the tests below:

###4.1. Controller tests

| Class | Test Goal |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |
| CreateSprintTaskController |	Ensure that the methods return a list|
| CreateSprintTaskController |	Ensure that the methods return a empty list|
| CreateSprintTaskController |	Ensure that the methods work with many scenarios to create a new task|
| CreateSprintTaskController |	Ensure that Mapper and DTO pattern were working|

        createFirstSprintTask() {
        //Arrange
        Company company = new Company();
        TaskMapper mapper = new TaskMapper();
        CreateSprintTaskController controller = new CreateSprintTaskController(company, mapper);

        //Create a project
        Typology typo = company.getTypologyStore().getTypologyByDescription("Fixed Cost");
        Customer customer = company.getCustomerStore().getCustomerByName("Teste");
        BusinessSector sector = company.getBusinessSectorStore().getBusinessSectorByDescription("sector");
        Project project = company.getProjectStore().createProject( "prototype", "test1234", customer,
                typo, sector, LocalDate.now(), 7, 5000);
        company.getProjectStore().saveNewProject(project);

        //Create a sprint
        Sprint sprint = project.getSprints().createSprint("Sprint 1", LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), 2);
        project.getSprints().saveSprint(sprint);

        //Create project team
        UserProfile profile = company.getUserProfileStore().getUserProfile("Visitor");
        SystemUser user1 = new SystemUser("user test", "test@test.pt", "test", "encript", "encript", "photo", profile);
        Resource res1 = new Resource(user1, LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2023, 2, 1), 100, 1);
        SystemUser user2 = new SystemUser("user test2", "test2@test.pt", "test", "encript", "encript", "photo", profile);
        Resource res2 = new Resource(user2, LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2023, 2, 1), 100, 1);
        SystemUser user3 = new SystemUser("user test3", "test@test.pt", "test", "encript", "encript", "photo", profile);
        Resource res3 = new Resource(user3, LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2023, 2, 1), 100, 1);
        project.getProjectTeam().saveResource(res1);
        project.getProjectTeam().saveResource(res2);
        project.getProjectTeam().saveResource(res3);

            //Create a new Sprint Task
        controller.getSprintTasks(project.getCode(), sprint.getId_Sprint());
        CreateTaskDTO dto = new CreateTaskDTO("newTask", "newTask to a controller test", 10, "deployment", "user test3");

        //Asserts
        assertTrue(controller.createSprintTask(dto));
        assertEquals(1, sprint.getTaskList().getTasksNames().size());
        assertEquals("newTask", sprint.getTaskList().getTasksNames().get(0));
    }

- *Ensure that all creation rules are work:*


        constructorCheckNameEmptyTest() {
        //Arrange
        Company company = new Company();
        UserProfile profile = company.getUserProfileStore().getUserProfile("Visitor");
        SystemUser user = new SystemUser("manuelbras", "manuelbras@beaver.com", "tester", "ghi", "ghi", "photo", profile);
        LocalDate startDateMb = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
        LocalDate endDateMb = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 31);
        Resource resource = new Resource(user, startDateMb, endDateMb, 100, .5);

        });
        }

- *Check if it can't add equals object to the list:*


        createSprintTaskTestRepeated() {

        Company comp = new Company();
        TaskList test = new TaskList();
        TaskMapper map = new TaskMapper();
        CreateTaskDTO dto = new CreateTaskDTO("test", "test test test tests", 10, "Meeting", "user test");
        CreateTaskDTO dto2 = new CreateTaskDTO("test", "test test test tests", 10, "Meeting", "user test");

        // Create Project
        Customer cust = new Customer("test", "test@test.pt");
        Typology typo = new Typology("test123");
        BusinessSector busSec = new BusinessSector("t1234");
        ProjectStatus status = new ProjectStatus("test1234");
        Project proj = new Project("project", "project test", cust, typo, busSec, LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), status, 4, 7000);
        comp.getProjectStore().saveNewProject(proj);
        UserProfile profile = comp.getUserProfileStore().getUserProfile("Visitor");
        SystemUser user = new SystemUser("user test", "test@test.pt", "test", "encript", "encript", "photo", profile);
        Resource resource = proj.getProjectTeam().createResource(user, LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2023, 2, 1), 100, 1);
        proj.getProjectTeam().saveResource(resource);

        test.createSprintTask(dto, map, proj);
        test.createSprintTask(dto2, map, proj);

        //Asserts
        assertEquals(1, test.getTasksNames().size());
        assertEquals("test", test.getTasksNames().get(0));
        }

# 6. Integration and Demo

Because many of the usage classes were already made and yours business logic were consolidated, 
the integration with them was simple. We need to verify some rules and implement others, 
but most of our work was devoted to the design and tests.      

# 6. Observations

As team, we need to better understand how to think about and define the tests that will be performed.
