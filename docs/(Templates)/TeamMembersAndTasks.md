# Project for ESOFT on the 3rd Semester of LETI-ISEP 

# 1. Team Members

The team is formed by the students identified in the following table. 

| Student Number	| Name |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **1190001**  | Name of student 1          |
| **1190002**  | Name of student 2          |
| **1190003**  | Name of student 3          |
| **1190004**  | Name of student 4          |


# 2. Task Distribution ###

Throughout the project's development period, the distribution of _tasks / requirements / features_ by the team members was carried out as described in the table below. 

Please notice that in every sprint there are:
- some tasks that **must be** carried out by all members as a **team**, in full cooperation. Those tasks are team responsibility and each member has the duty to positively contribute to its accomplishment.
- other tasks, related to the SDP activities in the scope of a single US, must be carried out mainly by a single team member. I.e. such US tasks are responsibility of a given team member.

Despite this separation of responsibilities, **all team members must work in cooperation and help each other as a team**.
Furthermore, it is worth noticing that all members should have knowledge/competencies about all project and not just about his/her part of the project.  

At last, remember that each User Story does not stand alone... it needs to be integrated with the remainders. Again, **integration** is a team responsibility.

**This table must be always up-to-date.**
